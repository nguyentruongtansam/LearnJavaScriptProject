## Meet the Interactive Feature Trainer

This interactive course will help you learn how to do some common tasks, like refactoring code or navigating through projects.

The course will be most useful for those who are new to WebStorm. However, if you're an experienced WebStorm user and feel like checking whether you know all the basic shortcuts, we encourage you to try it out, too.

### How to go through the course

The `Learn` tool window contains several modules with the corresponding sets of lessons that you can take in any order. When you finish studying a lesson, it will be marked as completed. You can use a completed lesson for your reference or restart it if you want to refresh your knowledge.

Even though a lesson looks familiar to you, give it a try: you may discover helpful examples and unknown shortcuts of the features you actively use!

### Manage shortcuts

Some shortcuts in this course may conflict with the system or other application shortcuts. In this case, you can click the problematic shortcut in the text of the lesson. The opened popup will show you the action name and alternative shortcuts. You will be able to apply the action or assign a new shortcut.

If there is another issue, try to restart the lesson or report the bug in [our bug tracker](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/IFT).

### Get back to your project

To return to the welcome screen, just close the project window. Alternatively, you can select `File | Close Project` fromthe main menu. Also, you can use the `File` menu to open or create new projects. By default, the `Learn` tool window is hidden. You can open it by selecting `Help | Learn IDE Features` from the main menu.
